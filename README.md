## Info

    - Note: In every functionality there will be prompts that will ask you if you have already done something needed for 
      it to work. This means that you don't necessarily need to use one function first before using the other.

    - Important: If your going to use this tool for any other activity then scraping make sure to select "Y" to scrape
      all users info because you will be needing their usernames.

    - Proxies: The formats of the proxies are hostname:port@username:password or hostname:port:username:pass. 
      I suggest using proxies for most functions 
      except for scraping / changing info :)  Using 0 proxies on everything should not be too bad, just make sure to use 
      multiple accounts if you do.

    - Admin Promoter: This feature needs atleast one of your clients to be admin in the channel and your clients to 
      have usernames. You can use the "Username Changer" to guarantee this works. 

    - Normal Scraper: This only works when a channel has their member list on public and only requires one client. 
      (scrapes almost instantly)

    - MassDM: The message.txt that is used for this tool is in HTML format, so if you want bold text for example you use
      <b>#text</b> and for an image you can just add an <a href=#Image link>.</a> to display this image and only add a 
      dot or anything as text else it won't show up :)

    - Mass Forwarder: Like MassDM but uses a forwarder message instead. After 3 flags in a row the message that your 
      using is 99% flagged so change it, flagged tokens can still be used in other functions and will be saved in 
      massforwarder/flagged-clients folder

    - Messages: In forwarding and mass messaging your message could get flagged if enough users report this message. 
      If you start to see "[ERROR] {phone} got flagged." prompt when trying to send this message it 99% means that this 
      message is flagged and that you should change it ASAP! (The bot stops when it detects this behaviour and prompts 
      the user)
      
    - Message Scraper: This function scrapes all messages in the channel and saves the users info of the sender of that 
      message, this way you can also scrape channels that have their member list disabled aslong as chatting is allowed. 

    - accounts.json: This is just a way to manually login to your clients, just a bit faster than normal. 
      If you find it annoying that it keeps asking if you want to use accounts.json you can simply remove the accounts 
      from the list and use sessions / tdata instead. This way it won't prompt you anymore :)

    - Bio Changer: Max length of a telegram bio is 70 characters, the same rules apply here.

    - Admin Promoter: Promotes your clients to admin in your group and option to choose their admin title / if they will
      appear as  invisible or not.
    
    - Verification Scraper: This feature uses the title of the channel to scrape the members, this would normally not 
      work with the channel its @. Make sure that atleast one of your clients is in this channel through manually 
      verifying if needed.
